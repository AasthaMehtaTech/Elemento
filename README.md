## About The Project :heart:

![Customizable Portfolio Screenshot](https://github.com/Vidit-jindal/hello-world/blob/master/CustomizablePortfolio.png)

Customizable Portfolio is a website that aims to help people make a fully functional static website in a short amount of time without relying on web developers and that too with very little prior programming experience.

This project is part of **PSoC** (PClub Summer of Code) organized by UIET Chandigarh. It is a 2 month long open source competition to help people get started with open source with the help of experienced mentors.
